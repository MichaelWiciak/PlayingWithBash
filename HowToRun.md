To run a Bash script file, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Bash Script:**
   Open a text editor and paste the script into a new file. Save the file with a `.sh` extension, for example, `timeTaken.sh`.

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Run the following command to make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x print_index_script.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script by running the following command:
   ```bash
   ./print_index_script.sh
   ```
   If you're not in the same directory as the script, you might need to provide the full path to the script or move it to a directory listed in your `PATH` environment variable.

The script will execute, and you should see the output on the terminal.
